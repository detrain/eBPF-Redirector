# xdp redirector

# Process List
Don't see it in the process list. The program is loaded into the eBPF VM and gets associated with an interface. You can use `ip link` to show loaded programs on an interface.

# Socket Table
Don't see it as there isn't any "connections" associated with redirecting at such a low level. Similar to how iptables redirected traffic, but XDP sits even lower and forces the developer to create the mapping.

# rsyslog

/var/log/iptables.log
Don't have any logs associated with the connection details, see next tcpdump explanation.

# tcpdump
Don't see any traffic here because XDP sits at a lower point than what tcpdump sees. Need xdpdump to view traffic being handled at the same level an xdp program handles traffic.
